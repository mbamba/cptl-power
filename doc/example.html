      <h1>Detailed Example</h1>
      <p>Although there are a wide variety of components within a
      power control network, we now demonstrate the capabilities of
      our language by constructing a module to encode and subsequently
      analyze part of a protection scheme for a transmission
      substation.  Specifically, we focus on constructs for various
      breaker control schemes.  By the end of this guide, you will
      understand how to do the following:</p>
      <ul>
	<li>Graphically define constructs for various breaker control
	schemes.</li>
	<li>Use a graph database to analyze dependencies within thoe
	constructs and generate inventories of assets.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Graphical Constructs for Breaker Control Schemes</h2>
      <p>We are now going to define various constructs needed for
      breaker control schemes.  There are a variety of different ways
      that one can configure a recloser control.  Each of these
      alternatives is listed below.  Please note that each of the
      components are composed from items in
      our <a href="catalog.html">catalog</a>.</p>
      <ul>
	<li>A Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) is connected to a breaker.</li>
	<li>A Breaker Control is connected to a breaker.</li>
	<li>An RTU is connected to a Breaker Control, the Breaker
	Control is subsequently connected to the breaker.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>RTU To Breaker</h4>
      <p>In the following images we see that an breaker <em>B</em> may
      be controlled by a direct connection with an RTU.  One of the
      goals of our CPTL language is to be able to operate on
      cyber-physical systems at multiple levels of granularity.
      Therefore, we show how our yEd interface to CPTL-compliant
      GraphML files accomplishes this goal.

      source is also available for this schematic.</p>

      <h4>Breaker Control to Breaker</h4>
      <p>Another option is to connect the breaker to a breaker
      control.  Please note,
      the <a href="../data/graphs/constructions/schematic/BreakerControlInstallation.graphml">GraphML</a>
      source is also available for this schematic.</p>

      <h4>RTU to Breaker Control to Breaker</h4>
      <p>Finally, we can connect the breaker control to an RTU so that
      the breaker may be manually controlled via SCADA.  Please note,
      the <a href="../data/graphs/constructions/schematic/RTUBreakerControlInstallation.png">GraphML</a>
