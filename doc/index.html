      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>We are interested in reasoning about how the topology
      (connectivity) of assets within the electrical power grid
      affects physical, economic, and security measurements.  We
      therefore introduce a domain-specific language whose intent is
      to allow us to analyze thse different aspects of power systems.
      When applied to the power grid, this language will allow us to
      analytically evaluate the design and ongoing state of
      generation, substation, and distribution networks relative to
      architectural, physical, and security tradeoffs.</p>

      <p>Within the course of this small tutorial, we will demonstrate
      how this language may be used immediately for a variety of tasks
      including (1) dependency analysis, (2) network inventory
      generation, and (3) network diagramming.</p>

      <h2>Requirements</h2>
      <p>This module has the following requirements:</p>
      <ul>
	<li><b>xsltproc</b>:  We use XSLT to transform various views
	of the cyber-physical system.</li>
	<li><b>yEd</b>:  We
	use <a href="http://www.yworks.com/en/products_yed_about.html">yEd</a>
	to create schematics for cyber-physical constructs.</li>
	<li><b>Neo4j</b>:  We
	use <a href="http://www.neo4j.org">Neo4j</a> to query
	different cyber-physical constructs.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Our Approach</h2>
      <p>Practitioners have a wide variety of views of a transmission
      substation, each of which encode a wide variety of relations at
      a variety of different levels of granularity.  For example, a
      transmission substation may have a one-line diagram
      (<em>physical</em> relations) and a network diagram associated
      with it (<em>cyber</em> relations).</p>

      <p>We interpret each of these diagrams as a visual
      representation of a database of relations that may be queried
      and used in reasoning about the state of the cyber-physical
      systems within the power grid.  One can compose these relations
      in a large variety of ways and in this sense, the language is
      extensible.  On the other hand
      certain <em>constructs</eM>---subgraphs of assets and relations
      among those assets---are more common than others within power
      system design and we can represent these as a construct.
      Moreover, the relations within a graph may yield certain
      behavioral properties that we may capture within a set of
      functions.</p>

      <h3>Our Focus for This Release</h3>
      <p>The image below shows our focus for this release: the ability
      to create schematics of cyber-physical constructs and operate
      upon those constructs within a graph database.  This release
      shows initial results with a small example that enables
      practitioners to <a href="catalog.html">diagram cyber-physical
      networks for industrial control systems</a>,
      and <a href="queries.html">perform basic analyses by querying a
      graph database</a> of these constructs.</p>

	<p>Our focus for this release:  the ability to create
	<a href="catalog.html">schematics of cyber-physical
	constructs</a> and <a href="queries.html">query
	constructs</a> within a graph database.</p>
      </div>

      <p>Specifically, we create visual representations of
      cyber-physical constructs using GraphML (via yEd) and then
      translate those constructs into the analogue of an <em>abstract
      syntax tree</em> for a visual language (via the schematic2asl
      <a href="../Makefile">Makefile target</a>).  We then translate each of these <em>syntax
      tree</em> data structures into a Neo4j Cypher <em>CREATE</em>
      statement (via the asl2neo4j Makefile target).  Once in the
      database, we can generate network inventories and perform basic
      dependency analyses.</p>
